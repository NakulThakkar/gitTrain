GIT PULL-

git pull
implicitely the command becomes git pull origin master.
the details like which origin and which branch are interanlly taken from "git config --get branch.master.remote" and "git config --get branch.feature2.merge."

Refer SO- "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23953125/difference-between-git-pull-and-git-pull-origin-master/23953209#:~:text=git%20pull%20origin%20master%20will,branch%20name%20in%20gitconfig%20file."

when you use just-

1.git pull

The pull will take place for all the branches which have the local and the remote mapping.

The pull will merge only the active/current/* branch


2.git pull origin master

git will ONLY pull the details from the remote for the branch specified in the command, here just master.

the git pull behavior is same as git pull origin <branch> for only those branches that are mapped with their upstream branches.



GIT ADD-

Suppose my current branch has 3 files- one.txt, two.txt and three.txt.
Now I delete one.txt from local.
Also I add ten.txt from local

git status will show 

deleted: one.txt
newfile: ten.txt 

scenario 1- I do git add . and git push

The deletion of file one.txt from local is reflected to the repo

scenario 2- I do git add ten.txt and git push

Git does not ack/record the local file deletion and just pushes ten.txt to repo

NOTE-

You use git rm for only those files that you want to delete from the git terminal.
when git is already prompting you the file as "deleted: one.txt" then there is no
use in using git rm. Git knows that its deleted. It is just letting you know about
it :).

now the question is- do you want to reflect that deleted files in the repo as well?

if yes then- just use git add .
if only a few of them then- git add <f-name>
if none and you have created new files to be pushed then- git add <new_f-names>
